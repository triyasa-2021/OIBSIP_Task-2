He then taught for a short time at Khulna Bagerhat College and later at Ramyas College, Delhi for a year.  The poet started teaching at BM College, Barisal in 1935.  Decades later, Jibanananda took the initiative to return to Calcutta.  Partition confirmed his arrival in Calcutta.  At this time he had to stay unemployed for a long time.

        <h3>Respect and Recognition: </h3>
        <p> Rabindra - Jibanananda Das, one of the most talented poets of later Bengali poetry, did not get respect in his lifetime.  After his death, the Government of India honored him with the Sahitya Akademi Award.  Rabindranath called his poems "pictorial".</p>
        <h3>End of life: </h3>
        <p>Jibanananda's life came to a sudden end by way of a road accident when he was only 55. On 14 October 1954, he was crossing a road near Calcutta's Deshapriya Park when he was hit by a tram. Jibanananda was returning home after his routine evening walk. At that time, he used to reside in a rented apartment on the Lansdowne Road. Seriously injured, he was taken to Shambhunath Pundit Hospital. Poet-writer Sajanikanta Das who had been one of his fiercest critics was tireless in his efforts to secure the best treatment for the poet. He even persuaded Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy (then chief minister of West Bengal) to visit him in hospital. Nonetheless, the injury was too severe to redress. Jibanananda died in hospital on 22 October 1954 eight days later, at about midnight. He was then 55 and left behind his wife, Labanyaprabha Das, a son and a daughter, and the ever-growing band of readers.</p>
